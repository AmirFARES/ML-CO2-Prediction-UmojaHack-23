## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio! This project is a result of my participation in the **UmojaHack Africa 2023: Carbon Dioxide Prediction Challenge (BEGINNER)** on Zindi.

The challenge aimed to harness the power of machine learning and deep learning to predict carbon emissions in Africa using open-source CO2 emissions data from Sentinel-5P satellite observations. The goal is to assist governments and researchers in monitoring carbon emissions across the continent, even in areas with limited on-the-ground monitoring capabilities.

I am proud to share my journey and achievements in this competition, where I ranked in the top 50%. Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished:

## About the Challenge 🌍

The challenge focused on predicting carbon emissions in Africa, addressing a critical aspect of climate change mitigation. Accurate monitoring of carbon emissions is crucial for understanding their sources and patterns.

### Challenge Details 📝

- **Prizes**: I competed for a chance to win monetary prizes, with the top three participants receiving cash rewards. Additionally, there were country prizes for the highest-ranking participants from specific countries.

- **Evaluation**: The competition's performance metric was Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), used to assess the accuracy of predictions.

- **Datasets**: I utilized publicly-available, open-source CO2 emissions data obtained from Sentinel-5P satellite observations. The dataset included various features related to pollutants such as Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, and more.

- **Challenges**: I faced challenges in feature engineering, model selection, and data preprocessing to create a robust predictive model.

## How I Approached the Challenge 🚀

1. **Data Exploration**: I began by thoroughly exploring the provided datasets to gain insights into the data's structure and distribution.

2. **Feature Engineering**: I engineered new features and transformed existing ones to extract meaningful information for building predictive models.

3. **Model Selection**: I experimented with various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: To improve model accuracy, I fine-tuned hyperparameters and optimized the model.

5. **Validation**: I used cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.

6. **Submission**: After obtaining satisfactory results, I created submission files following the required format.

## Results 📈

I am pleased to share that I achieved a ranking in the top 50% of participants in the UmojaHack Africa 2023 challenge. My predictive model demonstrated promising results in estimating carbon emissions.

## Future Steps 🌱

As I continue to develop my data science and machine learning skills, I plan to enhance this project further. Some future steps may include:

- Exploring advanced machine learning techniques.
- Incorporating additional external data sources for improved predictions.
- Enhancing model interpretability for stakeholders.
